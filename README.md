# macropad_to_gamepad

I Have:
- Elite Dangerous
- A left VKB joystick
- A right VKB joystick
- A Koolertron AE-SMKD / LingYao ShangHai Thumb Keyboard
  -- Based on the CY8C24794-24LTXI
  -- 46 programmable keys
  -- not the current model
- A need for even more buttons
- Linux
- Steam
- Proton
- Python 3

They say F13 through F24 make good macro keys. They are not quite right - /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet reserves them all for stuff like enabling/disabling/toggling touchpad. 

They work with Modifiers. Meta+F13 (looks like Win+F13 if it actually existed), Alt+F13, Ctrl+F13, Shift+F13 - 48 single mod keys.

Which Elite Dangerous will ignore. So This script
- Finds your macropad with F13 mapped, lest it select the emulated mouse you aren't using
- Creates a virtual Joystick named after it
- Emits button presses in the BTN_TRIGGER_HAPPY1 linux kernel event range, lest your button orders com out different than your FKEY orders
- Checks your Binds file that all the mentioned joysicks are attached, including the virtual ones

- I can't copyright this because nothing generated by ChatGPT can be copyrighted
- Could I have done this based on StackOverflow et.al. Posts before the place was torched by people (apporiately) mad the robot's crawl wasn't authorized, but was monitized, so now their posts only exist in it's learning data archive? Possibly.
